This is a final project login page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a beautiful glassmorphism UI with animated background, smooth transitions, and responsive layout for all screen sizes. The login form includes fields for username and password, client-side validation, and error handling with a shake animation. Demo credentials are included (Username: admin, Password: 1234) for testing. All files are stored in a clean structure with index.html for content, style.css for design, and script.js for functionality. To view it live, deploy this project to GitHub Pages by pushing to a GitHub repo and enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings. Once deployed, the live site will be accessible at https://your-username.github.io/final-project/ (replace 'your-username' with your GitHub handle). This project is perfect for showcasing frontend skills, especially UI/UX design, and is a great addition to any portfolio.
